# Hi humans ðŸ‘‹, I'm BÃ¡rbaro Javier Valmaseda

Software engineer and full stack developer, trying get my tech career back on track. I advocate the use of open source and started in the Web 3.0 world thanks to Platzi's #EthDevProgram. I would like to work in teams to contribute to development of open source and to the global adoption of blockchain technology, turning LATAM into a technological powerhouse.
